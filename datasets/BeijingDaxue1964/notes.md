# Hànyǔ Fāngyán Cíhuì (Běijīng Dàxué 1964)

This is the famous *Hànyǔ Fāngyán Cíhuì*, also known as *Chinese dialect vocabularies*, published in 1964 by an editorial team from Beijing University. 
The dataset was digitized and prepared to be amenable to lexicostatistic investigations during the years from 2014 until 2017, in as many as three different research projects (see section on funding below). 
We present here an initial version of the data which can be considered as "final", assuming that the number of errors in the digitization and additional analysis does not exceed 5%. 

The data is offered in different formats, as a word list file which can be loaded with LingPy and contains partial cognate sets, normal cognate sets (based on a conversion of partial cognate sets into strict identifiers), and alignments, corresponding to the partial cognate sets.

What is remarkable of the resource is that the coding is cross-semantic: since Chinese dialectologists annoated the so-called běnzì which is a rough etymology of each morpheme, the data is cognate-coded without regarding the meaning.
